# Clicky Game

## Overview

Click Game is a memory game created with React. Each of the application's UI is split into components with live response to user events.

## How to play

The application renders images to the screen. The user's score is incremented when clicking on an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

When an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page are shuffled in a random order making the user use their memory to ensure an incorrect guess isn't made.
